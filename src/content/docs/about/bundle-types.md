## Bundle Types

SCS defines five distinct bundle types, each serving a specific purpose in the context hierarchy.

:::note[Coming Soon]
Full documentation of bundle types is being developed.
:::

## The Five Types

1. **Meta Bundle**: The SCS specification itself
2. **Standards Bundle**: External compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2)
3. **Domain Bundle**: Company-wide knowledge aggregator
4. **Concern Bundle**: Functional area standards (Architecture, Security)
5. **Project Bundle**: Individual project context

## Bundle Hierarchy

```
Project Bundle → Domain Bundle → Concern Bundles → Standards Bundles → Meta Bundle
```
