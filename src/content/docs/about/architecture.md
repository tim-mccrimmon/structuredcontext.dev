:::note[Coming Soon]
Detailed architecture documentation is being developed.
:::

## Overview

SCS is designed as a git-native specification for managing AI context:

- **Declarative**: Context defined as YAML/JSON
- **Composable**: Bundles can import other bundles
- **Versioned**: Immutable versions with semantic versioning
- **Validated**: Structure and imports validated before deployment

## Design Principles
